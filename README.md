## Notes
This game was created as a first steps into ARKit. To keep the project simple, it follows the MVC pattern so it can serve as an intro to ARKit's newcorners. To fully enjoy the game make sure you play with sound, so you can listen to every sound effect and background music. The game itself was inspired on ARniegeddon
